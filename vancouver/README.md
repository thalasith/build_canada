City of Vancouver has ~9,500 employees.

The financial statement on page 21 states that it reports on the following consolidated entities:

1. Hastings Institute Inc.
2. Vancouver Civic Development Corporation
3. Harbour Park Development Ltd. 
4. City of Vancouver Public Housing Corporation
5. Parking Corporation of Vancouver (EasyPark) 
6. Pacific National Exhibition (PNE)
7. Vancouver Economic Commission 
8. Vancouver Affordable Housing Agency

It seems to be missing a lot of other entities or organizations which I am sure is covered (e.g. Vancouver Police Department? Vancouver Fire Department?)
